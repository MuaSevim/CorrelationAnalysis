# Correlation Analysis

Correlation analysis is a way of finding relation between variables.
It is done by comparing each variable with each other and finding the most related ones.

If the result of comparison is close to 1 they are perfectly related.
If the result of comparison is close to 0 they are not related at all.
If the result of comparison is close to -1 they are perfectly related but in opposite ways. (If one is true other one is false)
